[SCRT] SecretCoin

What is SecretCoin?
SecretCoin is a cryptocoin (X11 PoW + PoS coin) to use in a several casual games.

How it will work?
You will be able to change SecretCoins for points and points for SecretCoins...and then to bitcoin.
Buy, sell, exchange coins/levels/weapons/stars with other users and play on-line

How many games do you planning to develop?
We aim to develop and deliver 25 games in the next 3-5 years.

But what kind of games?
Very simply games, for android, iOS and WindowsPhone.

Where I can change points for SCRT
We are building our own exchanger in our website.
You will be able also to buy points, SCRT or game features with okpay and paypal.

Do you have already launched any game?
No yet. Only a demo of the first game. Once POW phase ends, the first releases will be public and available to download from the stores.
You can watch the demo game on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxpN1-Z6_mU&feature=youtu.be

How can I test the demo?
The first game to be released will be "HitTheBox"If you have an Android device, follow this instructions:

1 - Download the "HitTheBox": https://mega.nz/#!cAcTTZCb
2 - Enter the decryption Key: !K_dslXrah-pxUcLSJjFQSq4j8JCYAhfWHmgOPhGO_5c
3 - Please install on your Android device (Developer mode must be on).
3 - Register with a bogus user and bogus password.
4 - Use the bogus user name and bogus password to login.
5 - Play "HitTheBox", mode "Freefall" only. "Defender" mode, isn’t available in this demo.This is only a login system test.

So if I' ll have 1000 points will it means 1000 SCRT earned?
No, it will not. Exchange rate will depend from the current SCRT price average in the markets.

How much will cost the downloads from the Stores?
The first 5 games will not cost more than 1 USD per download. Also they will be the most simply games.

But now, where I can buy SCRT?
At this moment, you can buy or exchange SCRT for BTC at:
Youbit: https://yobit.net/en/trade/SCRT/BTC#7D
or 
C-Cex: https://c-cex.com/?p=scrt-btc

Do you are planning to list the coin on other exchangers?
Yes. Dispite our initial plans were to add this coin listed after POW phase, Yobit add us.

bittrex - sent request, waiting for reply;
poloniex: sent request, waiting for reply;

Comments from the Team Secret
Our native language isn't English. So, we're sorry for any language mistake;
Our main goal is to develop the game and not to make another "pump and dump" coin;
This coin, with this specifications is a clone from another X11 coin and it has no specials features;
The nodes available are rented;
We have a simple wallet with a simple logo.
The coin distribution is perfect for our development and to give a chance to all users start the same way at the same time;
No pre mine stuffs;
Fair launch;
We will not mine this coin. The game will have an exchanger platform, so later we can collect our fees (around 0.3%);
Thank you for your understanding and support;
Any ideas, suggestions, you can email us: secretcoin@techie.com.

Smiley Happy Mining, Trading
