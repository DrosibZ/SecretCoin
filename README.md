# Comments from the Team Secret
0. Our native language isn't english. So, we're sorry for any language mistake;
1. Our main goal is to develop the game and not to make another "pump and dump" coin;
2. This coin, with this specifications is a clone from another X11 coin and it has no specials features;
3. We have a simple wallet with a simple logo.
4. The coin distribution is perfect for our development and to give a chance to all users start the same way at the same time;
5. No premine stuffs;
6. Fair launch;
7. We don't have bounties to offer, so if any wants to list our coin to any pool, we thank you;
8. We will not mine this coin. The game will have an exchanger platform, so later we can collect our fees (around 0.3%);
9. Thank you for your understanding and support;
10. Any ideas, suggestions, you can email us: secretcoin@techie.com.
